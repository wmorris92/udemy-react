View/Component - Some code that produces HTML.

Functional component - Component  which is just a JS function.

Class component - component to have some sort of internal record keeping. (e.g. search bar needs to tell app what was written)

State - JS object exists on a class based component. Can change state.

When changing from functional to class based component change props => this.props.

Add a key to list items for optimization.
