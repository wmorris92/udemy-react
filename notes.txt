View/Component - Some code that produces HTML.

Functional component - Component  which is just a JS function.

Class component - component to have some sort of internal record keeping. (e.g. search bar needs to tell app what was written)

State - JS object exists on a class based component. Can change state.

When changing from functional to class based component change props => this.props.

Add a key to list items for optimization.

In the View-Data image, React is the views and Redux is the Data.

Redux - State container, all the data for the app, hard (list of data) and meta (currently selected)

React - the View, translates data to screen for user interaction.

Reducers - Function that returns a piece (value) of application's state.

Containers - Smart components, connect react to state from Redux.
